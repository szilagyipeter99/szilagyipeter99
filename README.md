ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Peti.

I hold an MSc in Mechatronics Engineering, graduated in 2023, and am currently pursuing a PhD with a focus on machine learning, microscope automation, and image processing. In addition to my research, I teach Electrotechnics, Electronics, Image Processing, and Embedded Systems courses at the University of Debrecen.
